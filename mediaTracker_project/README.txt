Have you ever been binge watching a lot of tv shows and movies, so much so that when you 
come across those movies again, you can’t remember if you watched them or not? Movie 
Tracker is an easy solution to this problem. All that the user has to do is make an 
account on the website and start searching through a list of almost every movie or series 
available. If that’s too overwhelming, then you can narrow down your search by selecting 
to search through exclusively movie titles or series titles.
	
Each media card gives a detailed description of the media, including the title of media, 
how many movies are in the series or how many seasons there are, as well as the average 
rating, and the sites that are available for streaming the content. All of the information 
that you could ever need about watching your favorite shows or discovering new ones is all 
localized into one place.
